1. Create a blank page  with size approximately 8cm \* 15cm (in **Formatting tab**).
<br />
2. For multiple graphs you can create a grid (in with zero margins preferably) and specify the columns and rows (in **Properties tab**).
<br />
3. Then we create the graph  with margins as (in **Formatting tab**)-
 
   ```
   Left margin: 1.5 cm
   Right margin: .5 cm
   Top margin: .3 cm
   Bottom margin: .2 cm
   ```
<br />
4. And in x and y section of graph we add label of x-axis and y-axis (in **Properties tab**) we set the font family and font size (in **Formatting tab**) as:
 
   ```
   font: Times New Roman
   Size: 10pt
   ```
<br />
5. Then we import the data **.csv** file (in can be created with excel) in the veusz and link it (Save data csv and veusz file in the same folder so we can conveniently change the data in the data .csv file).
<br />   
6. Then we click the **Plot points** icon and after that we add the data for x - axis and y - axis and **key text** (in **Properties tab**). We can add multiple plots(in **Formatting tab**) according to our needs.
<br />   
7. We can also change the markers in the graphs as well as line width and color .

    ```
    line color: 1.5 cm
    line width: .5px
    ```
8. Add **key** in graph and keep font and font size as above.
<br />   
9.  After everything is done always export file **PDF** format.
